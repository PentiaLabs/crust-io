# Release Management

Release Management is the process of managing, planning, scheduling and controlling software builds through different stages and environments; 

## Benefits
-	We know what version of the solution is deployed to each environment.
-   Provides the ability to fix specific issues in a specific environment withut deploying new features, typically a hot fix in production.
-	Enables development to continue whist the solution is being tested.
	
Whilst the aim of Release Management is the same regardless of which source control system you use!
Each source control system has its own way to achieve Release Mangement i.e. branching, tagging, cloning, etc.
Therefore we have 2 SOPâ€™s one for [Git](/Home/Backend/Release%20Management/GIT/) and one for [SVN](/Home/Backend/Release%20Management/SVN/).

In the past we have used [SVN](/Home/Backend/Release%20Management/SVN/), but for new projects we will use [Git](/Home/Backend/Release%20Management/GIT/).
