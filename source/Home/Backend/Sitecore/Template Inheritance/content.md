# Use template inheritance

- Never create fields directly on a template which can be created by the editors.
- Always prefix DATA templates with __
- Never create items directly from DATA templates
- Keep one layer of inheritance, let each page type agrigate all the data templates.
- Favor Composition over Inheritance

> Enhances maintainability and flexibility
