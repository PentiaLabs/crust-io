# Solid Principles 

SOLID stands for the five good basic principles of object-oriented programming and design, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) or [Google it](https://www.google.dk/?ion=1&espv=2#q=solid+principles)

- **S** - Single responsibility principle
- **O** - Open/closed principle
- **L** - Liskov substitution principle
- **I** - Interface segregation principle
- **D** - Dependency inversion principle

### Single responsibility principle

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

### Open/closed principle

> Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov substitution principle

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program

### Interface segregation principle

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

### Dependency inversion principle

> Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
