# Modular Architecture

Modular Architecture is based on a number of well-defined principles:

- [Packaging Principles](/Home/Backend/Modular%20Architecture/Packaging%20Principles/)
- [SOLID Principles](/Home/Backend/Modular%20Architecture/Solid%20Principles/)

  In order to support the afore principles, we have introduced the following a number of additional terminology and concepts

  - [Layers](/Home/Backend/Modular%20Architecture/Layers/)
  - [Module (previously called component)](/Home/Backend/Modular%20Architecture/Module/)

We also rely on the following principles/methodologies 
- [Domain Driven Design]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
- [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

Sitecore have based [Habitat](https://github.com/Sitecore/Habitat/wiki/01-Getting-Started) on Modular Architecture, for more info see [Laub's blog](https://laubplusco.net/the-groundbreaking-sitecore-habitat/)
