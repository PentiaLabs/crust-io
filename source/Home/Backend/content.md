#Backend

We have to adopt and use world class proven architecture principles, design patterns and coding practices. 
As over the past few years, the Complexity, Size, Cost & the amount of Integrations has increased dramatically.

## Goals

SOP defines **how** we develop solutions at Pentia, but it is equally important to understand **why** we do it and what the goal is.

- Reduce maintenance cost
- Achieve quality, consistency and stability
- Isolate "bad, unstable legacy" code
- Provide a context to help communication between developers and customers
- Reduce the cost of adding/modifing features
- Deliver on time and on budget.

### Side effects

- Reusability
- Enable project rotation
- Common terminology across solutions
- More developer time to do actual productive work
- Easier to remove functionality
- Time to reflect upon code share experience and learn new stuff all in all have more fun
