# About

To be able to live up to todays demands for high performant web applications, and at the same time maintain the highest possible degree of developer ergonomics, we need to arrange our tooling in a way that the source files of a solution are easy to work with on the developer end of things, and when it comes to production are handled in a way that facilitates all the best practice conventions that in the end provides a solid set of assets ready to be consumed by web browsers.

The idea behind the FrontendBuilder is to create the most cutting edge setup possible for processing (less-/sass-preprocessing, script-concat and -uglifying, vector graphics and image optimization, livereloading etc.) of client side resources.

The ambition is to make the installation process a breeze making everyday development and deployment processes as easy as possible, all the while making it possible for developers to have the best and most modern tools for development and debugging at hand.

The backbone of the project consists of our own oppionated stack, which makes it easy to do static prototypes, work with modular JavaScript and context agnostic css.
