# Starting a new project

(This SOP is work in progress)

Sometimes you'll be starting up new projects. These are the main things to consider when doing so.

 * **Read through the acceptance criterias with a critical eye.**

 The content inside the acceptance criteria document is the agreement between us and the client, and they're basically the contract that determines whether or not we'll end up with satisfied customers. If there's something that isn't clear to you as a developer, take pride in clearing things up. Remember to be thorough in documenting any new agreements you make with the client.

 * **Do frequent UX/Design reviews**

 Step away from your computer. Invite your colleague on a cup of coffee and walk through the solution. Remember to pay special attention to proposed solutions that can be difficult to realize in regard to the browser requirements for the project.

 * **Install the FrontendBuilder**

 Instructions are found [here](/Home/Frontend/Develop/FrontendBuilder/).

 * **Get icon set from design and setup SVG processing**

 Instructions on how to setup SVG processing can be found [here](/Home/Frontend/Design/Media/SVG/).

 * **Get touch icon from design and setup touch icons**

 Touch icon instructions can be found [here](/Home/Frontend/Design/Media/Touch%20icons/).

 * **Read about, understand and implement the JavaScript mediator-pattern**

 All the info you'll need can be found [here](/Home/Frontend/Code/JS/Mediator%20Pattern/).

 * **Begin building an Atomic Design component inventory**

 Convince the project manager why this is a good idea.

 * **Think about how to provide an extra level of service to the customer**

 Call them explaining how much you're looking forward to their project. Let them know you've understood their needs. Challenge them to a game of fussball or something like that. Remember our values.
