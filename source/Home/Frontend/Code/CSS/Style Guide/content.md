# Style Guide

## Formatting and whitespace

### Casing

*   Lowercase only
*   Hyphen between words - just as with CSS properties.

```css
/* Good */
.add-to-cart-button {}

/* Bad */
.addtocartbutton {}
.addToCartButton {}
.add_to_cart_button {}
```

### Rules

*   One space after selector
*   Opening curly-brace followed by new line
*   Closing curly-brace on new line
*   Blank line between rules - this will improve readability in version control tools.

```css
/* Good */
.selector {
    color: #000;
}

/* Bad */
.selector{color:#000;}
```

### Declarations

*   One declaration per line - this will also improve readability and comparison in version control tools.
*   Colon and one space after every property
*   Semi-colon after every value

```css
/* Good */
.selector {
    color: #000;
    font-size: 20px;
}

/* Bad */
.selector {
    color:#000; font-size: 20px
}
```

#### Multi-value declarations

*   Put each expression on a new line

```css
.selector {
    box-shadow:
        0 0 5px 0 black,
        inset 0 0 0 1px red;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

## Indentation

We use tabs for indentation. We've made an active choice in doing so, the main reason being that tabs can be personalized. The width of a tab character can be adjusted per editor. This means that people can view your code in the way they feel comfortable with, not in the way you prefer.

## Comments

All our CSS is written with a pre/post processor. This enables single-line `//` comments that donâ€™t exist in the CSS spec.
