# Accessibility

Accessibility is important. It matters a great deal to those trying to use our software with a disability. It will also be a part of the acceptance criterias for a fair deal of projects, so it's something we need to deal with - and it's simply the right thing to do.

Writing sane semantic HTML, CSS that's flexible with layout & font-size will go a long way in making a web app as accessible as possible.

By using the tools listed below you're sure to be serving up a solution that's accessible for people with disabilities. Way to go, you!
