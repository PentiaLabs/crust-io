# Templating

## Nunjucks

We've chosen [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as the chosen templating engine for whenever we need templating support in our web applications.

It can be used both on the server side and the client side and has a vast variety of features and extensibility and is well documented. It's developed by Mozilla, so development and backing shouldn't run out of pace any time soon.

## Questions

**Why am I seeing Swig on some legacy projects?**

In older projects you will probably run into [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/) templates which in syntax resembles [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) quite a lot. We made the decision to switch from [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/) to [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) because of a statement made by the author about no longer maintaining the template engine and encouraging people to switch to nunjucks.
