# Handover

To have our projects running as smoothly as possible, the interdisciplinary processes needs to be well proven and documented.

When handing over design work these are the instructions and requirements that the design team should strive to fullfil in order for the project to run as effective as possible, and to ensure that the frontend developer has all neccessary information and assets availabe to continue the project.

<li><a href="#Section1">All Psd files should be available</a></li>
<li>Potentially protected fonts should be available (Read more <a href="/Home/Frontend/Design/Typography/Handover/">here</a>)</li>

<a id="Section1"></a>
## All PSD files should be available

Make sure that the design files are available at all times. Preferable on the S-drive It is possible that the designfiles has to be used before the design is finally approved. For example for prototyping, estimates etc.

In case the design is placed in InVision Passwords and URL's should appear on the intranet.

## A module design file with all modules

Besides page templates all design modules should be placed on one single file, a module design file. Think of this as a complete module inventory list - much like the first page of a LEGO instructions manual where all the bits and pieces are layed out.

Naming convention of modules should follow the UX module page.

## A version of the website on very large screen

It's not always obvious where the boundaries of rows and ribbons goes just by looking at a design. Therefore PSD/InVision visuals must describe or provide an example of the design on a very large screen to eliminate doubts on how the design should behave on a such device.

## Documentation on hover/behaviours

The styleguide should contain hover/behaviours if these are defined by the designer.

<a id="Section6"></a>
## Logo and icons should be available as svg-icons
The logo should be available in a svg version as well as a png-version. Icons in the design should be converted to svg. Do NOT use fonts for this.

**Single-color icons should have a fill color of #000000 when saving in Illustrator, this way the generated SVG won't have a `<style>` property containing a fill color.**

Read more about why SVG is the preferred choice [here](/Home/Frontend/Design/Media/SVG/#why-svg-).

<a id="Section7"></a>
## Other meta icons such as touch-icons, fav-icons etc
To be able to provide a valid touch icon for various platforms, design should provide at least a 260x260 bitmap.

More about how we process touch icons [here](/Home/Design/Media/Touch%20icons/)

<a id="Section8"></a>
## Passwords, URL's and other information to the material shold be documented on the intranet

Make sure the intranet is updated at all times. Don't wait untill you're "done". As it is the case with available designfiles you never know when next member of the pentia-family needs your work.

<a id="Section9"></a>
## PSD files should be in scale 1:1

If in anyway possible, the design files should be delivered in scale 1:1, NOT in retina design. (To be defined)
