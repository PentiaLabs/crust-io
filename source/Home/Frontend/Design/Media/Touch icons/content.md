# Touch icons

Web applications can be added to bookmarks and homescreens for quick launch on mobile and desktop devices. By doing so, the web application will leave a custom icon which indicates a way to launch the application. We're able to control what these icons look like, and in regard to brand compliance, we should make sure it looks correct for each platform.

## Generator

Until we get this build into our FrontendBuilder, the easiest way to get all the touch icons needed for you project is to run it through [RealFavIconGenerator](http://realfavicongenerator.net)

All you'll need is a 260x260 image from design, and you're ready to go.

The generation process will give you the files needed and also the HTML that needs to be injected into the master page.
