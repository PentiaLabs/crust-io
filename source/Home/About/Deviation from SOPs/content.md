# Deviation from SOPs

Sometimes you need to deviate from SOPs for pragmatic reasons and you should definitely be able to.
Before deviating; consult the **team leader** or **Core** for instructions on deviation procedures.

> For example "when we take over an existing project and the legacy code does not conform to how we build projects"
