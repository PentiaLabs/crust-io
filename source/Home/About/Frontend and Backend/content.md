# Frontend and Backend

## Separation of Concerns

In Pentia, we have separated development competencies into two technology-oriented areas, as we realized that there's simply too much to master when all competencies involved in developing a web solution are combined. These two areas are called Frontend and Backend, resp., and roughly speaking their coverage is:

- Frontend
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - Frontend build systems (ALM, in cooperation with backend)
  - Frontend oriented aspects of Sitecore, such as icons, etc.
  - Frontend oriented solution architecture (in cooperation with backend)
 

- Backend
  - C# (including asp.net Web Forms and asp.net MVC)
  - SQL (administration of server and T-SQL)
  - Backend/solution build systems (ALM, in cooperation with frontend)
  - Backend oriented aspects of Sitecore, such as template and button construction, as well as Sitecore installation, tuning, etc.
  - Backend/solution oriented solution architecture (in cooperation with frontend)

## The Small Print
  
Note, that this separation of concerns is technology-oriented; it doesn't state which part of a solution's logic is handled by a Frontend-developer and a Backend-developer, resp. - it only states that _if_ a certain technology, e.g. JavaScript, is used to implement some logic (be it presentation oriented or business logic oriented), then a Frontend-developer is expected to be able to do this in accordance with the SOPs.

As you may have noted in the description above, there's a close cooperation between Backend and Frontend, as we recognize that a solution (and ALM of this) is _one_ entity although many distinct competencies may have been involved in building it.
