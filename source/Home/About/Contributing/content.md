# How to contribute

Joined collaboration, typo crorections, bug-fixes, patches are essential for keeping our SOPs great. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Make sure you're a member of the [PentiaLabs](https://github.com/PentiaLabs) organization - if not apply for membership through [HelpDesk@pentia.dk](<mailto:HelpDesk@pentia.dk>)
* Go to the repository for these docs: [Pentia.SOPs](https://github.com/PentiaLabs/Pentia.SOPs) and follow the instructions on how to setup the solution on your machine.
* Submit a new issue for your errand, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the thing you want to improve.

## Powered by Crust

The SOPs website is generated by Crust, which is Pentias own static website generator. To be able to build the solution locally, and to know where to do changes, please consult the [readme for the Crust framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crust-io).

## Making Changes

* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a feature branch based on master; `git checkout -b my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.

## Making Trivial Changes

### Documentation

For changes of a trivial nature to typos and such, it is not
always necessary to create a new issue.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a feature branch.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the PentiaLabs organization. Describe what you've done inside the pull request thorougly!
* Update your issue to mark that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed.

## Deployment

This project deploys to an Microsoft Azure site, located at [sop.pentia.dk](https://sop.pentia.dk). To deploy this site push to the master branch and the rest is automated with a kudu script placed in the root of the repository called deployment.cmd
you should expect your changes to be available after 2 minutes. 

Thank you!
