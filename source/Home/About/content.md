# About

[SOPs](/Home/About/Standard%20Operation%20Procedures/) define how we strive to develop solutions at Pentia. 
They are the result of centuries of combined experience in developing web solutions, of having learned many things the hard way, trying many different widely-used paradigms and principles in a pragmatic no-bullshit manner to try to determine their suitability in our particular field of applications.
 
At the base of our [SOPs](/Home/About/Standard%20Operation%20Procedures/) is the Pentia-wide value set: **Fun**, **Respect**, and **Responsibility**.
This essentially translates into: having fun whilst treating ourselves, each other, and the customer with respect and in a responsible manner. 
The [SOPs](/Home/About/Standard%20Operation%20Procedures/) are just a bunch of rules on _how_ we do things - our value set is _why_ we do things how we do them.
 
## Mind the Gap
 
There is a large gap between a meta level value set and a concrete application of this. 
In our case we need to get from: 

- having fun whilst treating ourselves, each other, and the customer with respect and in a responsible manner

to a set of highly operational guidelines on how we build our architecture, our code, and our application lifetime management. We have tried to close this gap by considering what fun, respect, and responsibility means in terms of coding a web solution and the parties involved - Pentia, the Pentia employees and our customers.

### Closing the Gap

The following is our attempt at bridging the meta-level value set with our SOPs, the operational value sets: 

- It should be as easy as possible for an arbitrary developer in Pentia to:
  - implement the most likely changes
  - correct the most likely errors
  - move from one Pentia project to another Pentia project
- Tasks (big as small) should bed delivered on time and on budget.
- The solution should meet or exceed the customerâ€™s expectations (not just their requirements)
- Maintenance cost should be as low as possible

The intention is that all current SOPs can be traced back to these values, and that future SOPs are formulated with these values in mind. 

## Separation of Concerns

In Pentia, we have separated development competencies into two technology-oriented areas, as we realized that there's simply too much to master when all competencies involved in developing a web solution are combined. To support this separation, the SOPs are divided into the two sub-categories, each representing an area of copmpetency: Frontend and Backend. You can read more about the two areas here: [Frontend and Backend](/Home/About/Frontend%20and%20Backend/).

## Evolution
 
Please note that the [SOPs](/Home/About/Standard%20Operation%20Procedures/) are an agreement on how we _currently_ do things - _you_ might get an awesome idea on how to do things in a way which agrees with said value set but disagrees with the SOPs.
