# About Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs)

>A while ago I was talking to a friend of mine that works for a major pharmaceutical company, and we touched on the subject of methodology. He told me that where he worked they're very fond of using SOPs. People there would even say that if it’s not in a SOP, it’s not worth knowing. I instantly thought "We need that!"

We're quite a large team of developers and even though we don't work closely on a day to day basis, we're rotating on assignments and collaborating on each others work pretty much all the time. To be able to be more efficient in handovers, joined collaboration - well basically to almost always be able to hit the ground running - we need a process library for how we're doing our work and a compendium for what we believe in.

In our team we've had a good idea about what we believed in about different areas of our field in quite some time. All these ideas has been scattered around in markdown manifests, on intranet pages, in our heads, on e-mails and so forth, rendering them impossible to convey in aggregated form to newcomers, external collaborators or even long time colleagues.

The content on these pages is our collection of Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) that details how we make successful web applications. They're filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.

It documents the principles, standards, and practices that Pentia work by.

Basically so we're able to point to an artifact that says, “Hey! We have a SOP for that! Here you go, this is how Pentia currently thinks about [insert subject here].”

It's a living creature, it's unfinished and will change a lot. Bare with the short comings you might experience as you read along. We will strive to fill out the gaps, and you yourself are more than welcome to contribute.

We've put a lot of work into defining the way we think is the best, jotting it down, structuring and presenting it here. All we expect in return is that you to follow the SOPs when you work with us.

Thanks! Now let's hit homeruns smiling!
