# Crust

Static site generator with support for hiearichal page structure.

## Static site source

### Generator

To get started you need to have an app-folder with the page templates and content data. The best way to get this going, is to use the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator, which can be found here (TODO: insert link when generator is ready)

### Custom setup

If you're not into getting things done for you, you can choose the custom way of setting the sourcecode up.

(TODO: Elaborate on how to do that...)
